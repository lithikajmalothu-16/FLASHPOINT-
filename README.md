⚡ Flashpoint
Train Hard. Respond Harder.

The Problem
Every year, 190,000+ chemical incidents occur. 300+ people die from gas leaks. 3,340 workplace fires happen daily. In a cardiac arrest, brain death begins in 4-6 minutes—survival drops 10% every minute without intervention.
80% of these deaths are preventable.
The issue isn't lack of protocols. It's lack of consequence-based training. Traditional methods give you a manual and hope you remember it when someone's dying in front of you. Live simulations cost $10,000+ and can only be run a handful of times.
When the real emergency hits, most people freeze. Some make the wrong call. People die.

The Solution
Flashpoint is an AI-powered emergency response training simulator that shows you exactly what happens when you make the wrong decision—before real lives are on the line.
Using Gemini 2.5 Flash and Veo, we generate:

Realistic emergency scenarios (cardiac arrest, chemical spills, fires, floods, electrical hazards, gas leaks)
Dynamic decision trees with four contextual choices (Optimal, Risky, Assess, Escalate)
8-second outcome videos showing the real-world consequences of each decision
AI-powered performance evaluation with detailed feedback

You choose how to respond under pressure. The AI shows you what that choice causes. Then you learn why people lived—or didn't.
Fail safely. Rise with everyone.

How It Works

Select Your Crisis - Choose from six emergency scenario types
Decide Under Pressure - Gemini generates four realistic response options with a countdown timer
Watch the Consequences - Veo-generated video shows exactly what your choice leads to
Learn From Reality - AI evaluates your decision across Response Time, Accuracy, and Safety Protocol Adherence

No sugar-coating. No do-overs in the moment. Just the brutal truth of what happens when you're right—and when you're catastrophically wrong.
