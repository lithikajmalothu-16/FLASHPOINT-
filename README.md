# ⚡ Flashpoint  
**Train Hard. Respond Harder.**

---

## 🚨 The Problem  
Every year:  
- 190,000+ chemical incidents occur  
- 300+ people die from gas leaks  
- 3,340 workplace fires ignite daily  

In a cardiac arrest, brain death begins within **4–6 minutes** — survival drops **10% every minute** without intervention.  
Shockingly, **80% of these deaths are preventable.**

The issue isn’t a lack of protocols.  
It’s a lack of *consequence-based training.*

Traditional methods hand you a manual and hope you remember it when someone’s life is at stake.  
Live simulations cost **$10,000+** and can only be run a few times a year.  
When a real emergency hits, most people freeze.  
Some make the wrong call.  
People die.

## 💡 The Solution  
**Flashpoint** is an **AI-powered emergency response training simulator** that lets first responders *fail safely* — by showing the real consequences of their decisions **before real lives are on the line.**

Using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** and **Veo**, the platform generates:  
- 🧯 **Realistic emergency scenarios** — cardiac arrests, chemical spills, fires, floods, electrical hazards, and gas leaks  
- 🧠 **Dynamic decision trees** with four response options: *Optimal, Risky, Assess, Escalate*  
- 🎥 **8-second consequence videos** showing the real-world outcomes of each choice  
- 📊 **AI-powered performance evaluation** across *Response Time*, *Accuracy*, and *Safety Protocol Adherence*  

You choose under pressure.  
The AI shows you what that choice causes.  
Then you learn *why people lived — or didn’t.*

> **Fail safely. Rise with everyone.**

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Select Your Crisis** – Choose from six emergency scenario types.  
2. **Decide Under Pressure** – Gemini generates four realistic response options with a countdown timer.  
3. **Watch the Consequences** – Veo-generated video shows exactly what your choice leads to.  
4. **Learn From Reality** – AI evaluates your decision using performance metrics.  

No sugar-coating. No do-overs.  
Just the brutal truth of what happens when you’re right — or catastrophically wrong.
